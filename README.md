# Welding Techniques Repository

Repository of practical solutions and unconventional approaches in welding technologies.

## About the Project

This repository contains documentation on unconventional yet effective welding technologies based on practical experience and theoretical analysis. The project's goal is to share working solutions for complex production challenges.

## Contents

### 🔥 [TIG-source with Coated Electrodes](./TIG-source-with-coated-electrodes/)

Using a TIG welding power source with coated electrodes (MMA/SMAW) for welding thin-walled parts with the capability for "point-to-point" and "intermittent" operation.

**Main Topics:**
- Theoretical justification of the method
- Equipment setup
- Welding parameters for various metal thicknesses
- Troubleshooting common problems

**Applicability:** Welding thin-walled steel structures (1-2 mm) with basic coated electrodes when precise heat input control is required.

### 📚 Other Techniques

*Section under development. Additional methodologies will be added as practical experience accumulates.*

## Who This Repository Is For

- Welders working with unconventional tasks
- Welding production engineers and technologists
- Shop supervisors seeking optimal solutions
- Students and instructors of welding specialties
- Enthusiasts experimenting with equipment

## How to Use the Documentation

1. **Review the theory** - understanding the physics of the process is critical for safe experimentation
2. **Check equipment compatibility** - ensure your equipment has the necessary characteristics
3. **Start with test samples** - always test on scrap material before working on actual parts
4. **Document your parameters** - record successful settings to reproduce results
5. **Share your experience** - create Issues or Pull Requests with your additions

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Safety First:**
