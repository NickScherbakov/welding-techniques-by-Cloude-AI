Welcome to the welding knowledge hub! Researchers, engineers and hands‑on welders share theory, parameters, setups, failure analysis and real production cases.

- Exploring arc physics? See the "Theory" section.
- Tuning equipment and modes? Visit "Practice".
- Publishing new approaches or results? Share them in "Articles & Experience".

> Our goal is to connect knowledge and make it directly usable in the shop, lab and production line.

## Getting Started

- Read "Quick Start" then "Theory".
- Check "Practice": equipment, parameters, setup.
- Visit "Troubleshooting" for typical issues & fixes.

## Join the Community

- How to prepare material: see "Submission Templates".
- How to contribute: see "Contributing".
- Please respect the "Code of Conduct".

## Focus Areas

- Arc physics and metal transfer processes.
- Microstructure and weld metallurgy.
- Mode parameters, stabilization, quality control.
- Automation, sensors, vision, modelling & AI.
- Practical: edge prep, filler selection, equipment, safety.

If you already have material — open an Issue with a proposal.
