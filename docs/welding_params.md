## Welding Technique

### Basic Principles

#### 1. Arc Length

**CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** Maintain the shortest possible arc!

- **Optimal:** 1-2 mm (for 2-2.5 mm electrodes)
- **Maximum:** 3 mm (for 3 mm electrode)
- **Too short:** sticking risk, but easier to avoid with HF ignition
- **Too long:** unstable arc, excessive spatter, lack of penetration

**Visual control:**
- Correct arc: bright spot, clear boundaries
- Too long: blurred spot, crackling, sparks
- Too short: electrode "bogs down" in puddle

#### 2. Electrode Angle

**Flat position:**
- Angle to surface: 60-70°
- Tilt: backward from welding direction by 10-20°
- Transverse motion: minimal or none (for thin metal)

**Vertical position:**
- Upward: 70-80° angle to surface
- Downward: not recommended for thin metal
- Short arcs, pulses

**Horizontal position:**
- Angle: 70-80° to vertical wall
- Slightly downward to prevent sagging

**Overhead position:**
- Avoid if possible
- Angle: 80-90° to surface
- Only short pulses
- Minimum current

#### 3. Welding Speed

**General rule:**
- Thinner metal → faster welding
- Watch the weld pool
- Uniform speed = uniform bead

**Signs of correct speed:**
- Pool moves evenly behind electrode
- Constant bead width
- No burn-through or lack of penetration

**Too fast:**
- Narrow convex bead
- Lack of penetration
- Edge fusion failure

**Too slow:**
- Wide flat bead
- Burn-through risk
- Metal overheating

### Intermittent Technique for Thin Metal

This is the **key technique** for 1-1.5 mm thick metal!

#### Operating Principle

1. **Arc Ignition**
   - Bring electrode to 3-5 mm
   - Activate HF ignition
   - Immediately close to 1-2 mm

2. **Working Pulse**
   - Duration: 0.5-1.5 seconds
   - Form small weld pool
   - Advance 5-10 mm

3. **Arc Break**
   - Quickly pull electrode back 5-7 mm
   - Arc extinguishes
   - Metal begins cooling

4. **Pause**
   - Duration: 0.5-2 seconds
   - Observe pool solidification
   - Prepare for next pulse

5. **Re-ignition**
   - Bring electrode to solidified pool
   - HF ignition penetrates vitrified coating
   - Continue the weld

#### Pulse Parameters

**For 1.0 mm thickness:**
- Pulse duration: 0.5-1.0 sec
- Pause: 1.0-1.5 sec
- Travel: 3-5 mm per pulse

**For 1.5 mm thickness:**
- Pulse duration: 1.0-1.5 sec
- Pause: 0.5-1.0 sec
- Travel: 5-8 mm per pulse

**For 2.0 mm thickness:**
- Pulse duration: 1.5-2.0 sec
- Pause: 0.3-0.5 sec (or continuous)
- Travel: 8-12 mm per pulse

#### Working Rhythm

**Important:** Develop a stable rhythm!

Example: "One-two (pulse) - pause - One-two (pulse) - pause"

**Uniform rhythm ensures:**
- Equal heat input along entire weld
- Predictable quality
- No overheating

### Continuous Welding

For metal from 1.5 mm, continuous welding without breaks is possible.

**Technique:**
1. Ignite arc
2. Maintain stable short arc (1-2 mm)
3. Move uniformly along joint
4. Minimal or no transverse motion
5. Watch the weld pool

**Advantages:**
- Higher productivity
- Continuous bead
- Less vitrified coating inclusion in weld

**Disadvantages:**
- More heat input
- Distortion risk
- Requires higher skill level

## Modes for Specific Tasks

### Tack Welds

**Purpose:** Fix parts before final welding

**Parameters:**
- Current: 20-30% below working current
- Tack length: 5-10 mm
- Distance between tacks: 20-30 mm
- Technique: single short pulses

**Sequence:**
1. Ignite arc
2. Short pulse 0.5-1 sec
3. Form small fusion point
4. Break arc
5. Move to next point

**HF Ignition Features:**
- No need to break vitrified coating
- Fast movement between points
- High productivity

### Spot Welding

**Purpose:** Join parts at discrete points without continuous bead

**Parameters:**
- Current: working or +10-15%
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Spot diameter: 4-8 mm
- Distance between spots: per design requirements

**Technique:**
1. HF ignition
2. Pulse with penetration formation
3. Arc break
4. Move to next point

### Welding Closed Contours

**Problem:** Metal is cold at start of weld, overheated at end

**Solution:**

1. **Weld Start:**
   - Begin with current 10% above working
   - First 10-15 mm - metal preheating

2. **Middle Section:**
   - Working current
   - Stable mode

3. **Weld End (tie-in):**
   - 20-30 mm before start, reduce current by 10-20%
   - Tie in weld with 5-10 mm overlap
   - Gradually reduce current (if Down Slope function available)

### Welding Dissimilar Thicknesses

**Example:** 1.0 mm + 2.0 mm

**Principle:** More heat to thick part, less to thin

**Technique:**
1. Current: average between values for each thickness
2. Electrode angle: directed predominantly toward thick part (60-70° to it)
3. Arc: more often on thick part, periodic touches to thin
4. Speed: medium, control penetration of thin part

**Example mode:**
- Thicknesses: 1.0 + 2.0 mm
- Electrode: 2.5 mm
- Current: 45-50 A (between 40 for 1mm and 50-60 for 2mm)
- Technique: intermittent, arc 70% time on thick, 30% on thin

## Quality Control During Welding

### Visual Control

**Observe:**

1. **Arc Color**
   - Bright white center → normal
   - Red, dark → insufficient current or long arc
   - Too bright, blinding → excessive current

2. **Arc Sound**
   - Smooth hiss → normal
   - Crackling, clicks → unstable arc, check V-A curve and arc length
   - Humming → possible magnetic blow, relocate ground

3. **Weld Pool**
   - Uniform, mobile → normal
   - Too large, sagging → reduce current or increase speed
   - Small, solidifying quickly → increase current or slow down

4. **Bead Formation**
   - Uniform ripples → normal
   - Convex narrow bead → increase current or slow down
   - Wide flat → reduce current or speed up
   - Burn-through → reduce current, increase speed, use intermittent

### Heat Input Control

**Signs of overheating:**
- Metal begins glowing around weld
- Distortion, warping
- Burn-through
- Weld pool too fluid

**Actions for overheating:**
1. Reduce current by 5-10 A
2. Increase welding speed
3. Increase pauses between pulses
4. Allow part to cool
5. Use copper backing for heat dissipation

**Signs of insufficient heating:**
- Lack of penetration
- Edge fusion failure
- Convex weld
- Slag removes poorly

**Actions:**
1. Increase current by 5-10 A
2. Reduce welding speed
3. Shorten pauses between pulses
4. Improve edge preparation

## Parameter Adjustment During Work

### Problem and Solution Table (Quick Reference)

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Arc won't ignite | HF not working | Check settings, enable HF Start |
| Sticking | V-A curve too stiff | Increase V/A coefficient to 1.5-2.0 |
| Excessive spatter | Arc too long | Reduce arc length to 1-2 mm |
| Lack of penetration | Insufficient current | Increase current by 10-15 A |
| Burn-through | Excessive current | Reduce current, use intermittent |
| Arc deflects | Magnetic blow | Relocate ground |
| Uneven bead | Unstable speed | Develop uniform rhythm |
| Slag removes poorly | Low current or wet electrodes | Increase current, use dry electrodes |

### Adaptation to Conditions

**When welding outdoors:**
- Wind protection mandatory (screens)
- Wind cools metal → increase current by 10%
- More spatter from wind → use protective screens

**At low air temperature:**
- Metal colder → increase current by 10-15%
- Increase pulse duration
- Preheat weld areas

**At high humidity:**
- Mandatory use of baked electrodes
- Store in electrode oven
- Increased porosity probability
